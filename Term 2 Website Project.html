	<h1>Overview</h1>
	
	<h2>What is Apex Legends?</h2>
	
	<p>Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale developed by Respawn Studios. One can say it is a mix of Overwatch and PUBG, as Apex Legends has the abilites and player perspective of Overwatch, and the Battle Royale style and loot distribution of PUBG. Don't let that fool you though, as the movement mechanics in Apex Legends is far beyond what PUBG and Overwatch can achieve; from simple sliding to crazy grapple-boost-bunny-hopping-wall-jumping-boost-off-a-launchpad.</p>
	
	<h2>Who is Apex Legends made for?</h2>
	<p>Apex Legends caters to those who love a fast paced shooter and ejoys the RNG of battle royales, and those who enjoyed Respawn Entertainment's previous games such as Titanfall 1. Currently Apex Legends is rated for people 13 years or older.</p>
